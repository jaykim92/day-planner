Daily Planner using jquery and bootstrap

## Description of Application:
The day planner was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Moment, and jQuery. The day planner displays the current date at the top of the page as well as several rows for a regular work-day, from 9am to 6pm. Within each row, a user can input their plans for the hour. Clicking the save icon to the right of the row allows for the task to stay in local storage until cleared. The code was condensed thanks to the guidance of my TA Chad Tao. 

## Challenges: 
I made use of ternary statements to make code for if, else if, and else statements more concise and elegant. It was difficult to make use of the moment library to pull the current time to change colors of each row as time passes in the day due to my using both the hour and the minute. This was solved by using only the hour instead. Overall, I feel that I am getting more and more used writing JavaScript and jQuery to build applications.
